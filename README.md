# Mondrian Project
This Project focuses on understanding and implementing CSS Grid to design visually appealing web layouts inspired by artistic concepts. I practiced integration of art and web design by creating a digital representation of Piet Mondrian's iconic painting, "Composition No. III with Red, Blue, Yellow and Black," using CSS Grid.

Tools and Concepts Learned:
CSS Grid: Learnt how to create grid structures, defining the dimensions of rows and columns.
HTML Structure: Initialized the project by setting up HTML and corresponding CSS.
Div Elements: Created divs to represent the colored squares in the painting.
Positioning with CSS Properties: Used grid-column and grid-row to accurately position elements within the grid.
Design Flexibility: Experimentated with designs and using Flexbox in conjunction with CSS Grid for centering layouts.

Project Goal:
The goal of the project was to replicate Mondrian's painting through web design, blending creativity with technical skills in CSS Grid, essentially transforming a visual artwork into a digital format.

Learning Outcomes:
Mastery of CSS Grid layout techniques, including sizing grid tracks and positioning items precisely.
Familiarity with creating visually centered layouts using Flexbox alongside Grid.
Inspiration to explore further applications of grid-based designs in web development.
